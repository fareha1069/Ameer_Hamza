This involves identifying and onboarding reliable 3PL partners, negotiating cost-effective storage and fulfillment rates, and setting up efficient workflows for inventory handling. I coordinate inbound shipments, monitor stock levels in real time, and make sure that pick, pack, and ship processes are optimized for speed and accuracy.";

I regularly review performance reports, order accuracy, and turnaround times to identify gaps and implement improvements. By streamlining processes, I help reduce fulfillment costs while maintaining high customer satisfaction. Whether managing direct-to-consumer orders, multi-channel fulfillment, or Amazon distribution, I ensure that every order is processed without delays and in line with service-level expectations.";
