            <p className="text-[#092936] text-base leading-relaxed">
              I provided key advice to a 3PL shipping to FBA for the first time.
              I shared packing info on a call and labeling details through
              email, making sure everything met Amazon's rules. I also arranged
              a pickup by UPS to ensure their FBA stock was ready. This was
              crucial for Prime Day on July 11, 2023. I even worked on this
              project on a Saturday to meet their rush. My help prevented
              problems for their business and set them up well for Prime Day
              success.
