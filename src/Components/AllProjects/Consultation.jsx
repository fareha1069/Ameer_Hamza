const desc = `I provided key advice to a 3PL shipping to FBA for the first time. I shared packing info on a call and labeling details through email, making sure everything met Amazon's rules. I also arranged a pickup by UPS to ensure their FBA stock was ready. This was crucial for Prime Day on July 11, 2023. I even worked on this project on a Saturday to meet their rush. My help prevented problems for their business and set them up well for Prime Day success.`;
